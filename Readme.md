# MovieShowcase

Welcome to the MovieShowcase Project Repository.

## Introduction

I watch a lot of movies on my laptop and always end up second guessing whether I have watched a movie or not. Hence I created this application that automatically creates my personal Movies Watched List.

Whenever I download a movie to my laptop, a python utility is run in the background that gets the movie details and stores it into a database. 
That data is then used to create this online movie watched showcase.
